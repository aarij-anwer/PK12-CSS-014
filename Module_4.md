## **4.1 What is Computational Thinking?**

### **Defining Computational Thinking**
The concept of **Computational Thinking (CT)** was popularized by **Jeannette Wing (2006)**, who described it as a **problem-solving approach that applies computer science principles** to a wide range of domains. While the term existed earlier, Wing’s paper helped integrate CT into **K-12 education** and emphasized its role in **CS instruction and interdisciplinary learning**.

Computational Thinking is often used as a framework to **introduce coding into K-12 subjects** or as a **methodology for teaching CS as a standalone subject**. Though the Ontario Math and Science curriculum updates (Grades 1-9) incorporated coding concepts, the term **Computational Thinking** was explicitly introduced in the **revised Grade 10 Computer Studies course (ICD2O)**.

### **Elements of Computational Thinking**
According to **Grover and Pea (2023)**, CT consists of **concepts** and **practices** that guide problem-solving and computational artifact creation.

#### **CT Concepts**
1. **Logic and Logical Thinking** – Structuring reasoning processes for decision-making.
2. **Algorithms** – Developing step-by-step procedures to solve problems.
3. **Patterns** – Recognizing common sequences or structures within problems.
4. **Abstraction and Generalization** – Simplifying problems by removing unnecessary details.
5. **Evaluation** – Assessing solutions for efficiency, correctness, and usability.
6. **Automation** – Leveraging computational power to execute tasks efficiently.

#### **CT Practices**
1. **Problem Decomposition** – Breaking down complex problems into manageable parts.
2. **Creating Computational Artifacts** – Developing solutions through code, simulations, or models.
3. **Testing and Debugging** – Iteratively refining solutions to improve performance.
4. **Iterative Refinement** – Making continuous improvements through repeated testing.
5. **Collaboration and Creativity** – Engaging in teamwork and innovative problem-solving.

### **The Role of CT in Computer Science Education**
CT is **not limited to coding**—it extends into **critical thinking, problem formulation, and logical reasoning**. By integrating **CT practices** into the curriculum, educators can help students **develop transferable problem-solving skills** applicable to real-world scenarios.

## **4.2 Teaching Problem-Solving in CS Education**

### **What Does Problem-Solving Look Like?**
Problem-solving is a **fundamental skill** in Computer Science, requiring students to analyze challenges, develop solutions, and refine their approaches. In the CS classroom, this involves:
- Understanding **problem requirements**.
- **Decomposing** problems into smaller, solvable components.
- **Designing and implementing algorithms**.
- **Debugging and optimizing** solutions.

### **Effective Strategies for Teaching Problem-Solving**
1. **Live Coding & Think-Alouds**
   - Instructors can **demonstrate problem-solving in real-time**, verbalizing their thought processes to **model logical reasoning**.
   - Students engage by **predicting outcomes** and **suggesting solutions**.

2. **Pair Programming & Peer Instruction**
   - Students work together, exchanging ideas and **debugging collaboratively**.
   - Peer instruction helps address **common misconceptions** through discussion.

3. **Coding Interviews as a Teaching Tool**
   - **Simulating coding interviews** can improve **critical thinking and algorithmic problem-solving**.
   - Students learn to **verbalize their thought processes**, an essential skill for debugging and technical communication.

4. **Unplugged Activities**
   - Teaching **CT principles without a computer** (e.g., flowcharts, logic puzzles, paper-based algorithms) helps **reinforce foundational problem-solving skills**.

## **Conclusion**
This module emphasizes that **Computational Thinking is central to problem-solving in Computer Science**. By incorporating **logical reasoning, decomposition, and iterative refinement**, educators can equip students with the skills necessary to **approach problems systematically**. 

Additionally, leveraging **teaching strategies like live coding, peer instruction, and coding interviews** fosters **engagement, collaboration, and deeper learning**. By integrating these methodologies, CS instructors can **enhance problem-solving proficiency in students**, preparing them for **real-world computational challenges**.
