## **10.1 Algorithm Design**

### **The Role of Algorithms in Computer Science**
- **Algorithms are the foundation of computing**, defining the steps required to solve a problem.
- They must be **correct, efficient, and scalable**.
- Two common ways to represent algorithms:
  1. **Flowcharts** – Visual representation of decision-making and process flow.
  2. **Pseudocode** – Structured, high-level description of an algorithm.
- **Students may have prior experience** with flowcharts and pseudocode from **Grades 1-9 coding activities**.
- **In Grades 10-11**, students start with **basic flowcharts** before moving on to **complex pseudocode representations**.

### **Flowchart vs. Pseudocode**
| **Method** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Flowchart** | Easy to understand visually, good for explaining logic | Not scalable for complex algorithms |
| **Pseudocode** | Closer to actual programming, prepares for coding | Requires more abstraction and syntax familiarity |

### **Example: Flowchart for a Simple Tax Calculation Algorithm**
```plaintext
+--------------------------------+
| Start                          |
|--------------------------------|
| Input: Income                  |
|--------------------------------|
| If Income ≤ 50000              |
|    Tax = Income * 0.1          |
| Else                           |
|    Tax = 5000 + (Income - 50000) * 0.2 |
|--------------------------------|
| Output: Tax Amount            |
|--------------------------------|
| End                            |
+--------------------------------+
```

### **Example: Equivalent Pseudocode**
```python
START
   INPUT income
   IF income <= 50000 THEN
      tax = income * 0.1
   ELSE
      tax = 5000 + (income - 50000) * 0.2
   ENDIF
   OUTPUT tax
END
```

## **10.2 Algorithmic Analysis**

### **Understanding Algorithm Efficiency**
- **Algorithmic analysis measures efficiency in terms of runtime and memory usage.**
- **Big O notation** expresses how an algorithm’s runtime grows relative to input size (`n`).

### **Big O Complexity Classes**
| **Complexity** | **Class** | **Example Algorithm** | **Efficiency** |
|--------------|---------|------------------|--------------|
| **O(1)** | Constant | Hash table lookup | Fastest |
| **O(log n)** | Logarithmic | Binary search | Efficient |
| **O(n)** | Linear | Linear search | Scales directly |
| **O(n log n)** | Linearithmic | Merge Sort, Quick Sort | Common for sorting |
| **O(n²)** | Quadratic | Bubble Sort, Selection Sort | Slow for large inputs |
| **O(2ⁿ)** | Exponential | Recursive Fibonacci | Very inefficient |

### **Key Takeaways from Simon Peyton’s Algorithmic Analysis Video**
1. **Algorithm efficiency matters** – A well-designed algorithm can **dramatically reduce runtime** compared to a naive approach.
2. **Scalability is crucial** – Some algorithms work well for small inputs but become **impractical** as data grows.
3. **Choosing the right algorithm is key** – Depending on the problem, selecting the **optimal algorithm** leads to **better performance** and resource usage.

### **How to Integrate the TED Talk into the Classroom**
- **Discussion on Real-World Algorithms:**
  - Ask students to analyze how **search engines, recommendation systems, and AI models** use algorithms to make decisions.
- **Ethical Implications of Algorithms:**
  - Lead a debate on **bias in AI, privacy concerns, and algorithmic fairness**.
- **Hands-On Activity:**
  - Have students design their own **simplified decision-making algorithms** and discuss their **efficiency and fairness**.

## **10.3 Algorithm Analysis - Classroom Activity Example**

### **Experimental Approach to Algorithm Analysis**
- Students generate **random arrays of integers** and sort them using classic sorting algorithms.
- The program **records the sorting time** for different input sizes (`n`), demonstrating the real-world impact of algorithmic efficiency.

### **Example Assignment: Sorting Algorithm Runtime Analysis**
- **Task:** Implement sorting algorithms and compare their runtime for different input sizes.
- **Algorithms to implement:**
  - **Selection Sort (O(n²))**
  - **Insertion Sort (O(n²))**
  - **Merge Sort (O(n log n))**
  - **Quick Sort (O(n log n))**

### **Sample Python Code for Sorting Analysis**
```python
import time
import random

def selection_sort(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:
                min_idx = j
        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]

def measure_runtime(sort_function, arr):
    start_time = time.time()
    sort_function(arr)
    return time.time() - start_time

# Generate a random list of 1000 numbers
arr = [random.randint(1, 10000) for _ in range(1000)]
print("Selection Sort Runtime:", measure_runtime(selection_sort, arr.copy()))
```

### **Classroom Learning Outcomes**
- **Students observe the dramatic difference** in runtime between sorting algorithms.
- **Relates theoretical concepts (Big O) to practical performance**.
- **Encourages experimentation and data-driven conclusions**.
