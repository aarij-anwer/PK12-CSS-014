# **Module 7: Active Learning Methods (Peer Instruction & Live Coding)**

## **Overview**  
Module 7 focuses on **active learning techniques** in Computer Science (CS) education, specifically **Peer Instruction (PI)** and **Live Coding**. The module aims to help educators create engaging, student-centered classrooms.

---

## **Learning Outcomes**  
By completing this module, you will:  
1. **Develop active learning strategies** for your CS classroom.  
2. **Create effective Peer Instruction (PI) questions** to enhance student engagement.  
3. **Understand the purpose and implementation of Live Coding** as an instructional technique.

## **Key Concepts**

### **7.1 Peer Instruction (PI)**  
- **What is PI?**  
  - A **student-centric approach** where learners actively participate instead of passively listening.  
  - Encourages **peer discussions** to enhance understanding of CS concepts.  

- **How PI Works in a High School Setting:**  
  - **Clickers** are not typically used for assessment.  
  - Instead, teachers can use **Google Forms** for students to submit answers individually.  
  - After peer discussions, students submit **a second response** to check for improved understanding.  

- **Effectiveness of PI:**  
  - Research shows that **PI significantly benefits student learning** in CS courses.  
  - A study of **seven introductory programming instructors** showed:  
    - **92% of students** found PI valuable for learning.  
    - Success rates ranged from **74% (minimum) to 92% (average)**.  
  - **Key Finding:** Grading policies impact results—**participation-based grading** tends to yield better engagement than grading based on correctness.

## **Module 7 Tasks:**  
1. **Watch videos on Peer Instruction** (7.1).  
2. **Create a Peer Instruction question** and share it in the discussion forum (7.1).  
3. **Explore Live Coding resources**, including a **podcast by Mark Guzdial** (7.2).  
4. **Post a key takeaway about Live Coding** (7.2).

## **Key Takeaways from Live Coding**  
One of the most powerful aspects of **Live Coding** is its ability to **normalize mistakes** and reinforce a **growth mindset** in students. By coding in real time and **verbalizing the problem-solving process**, educators model how programmers approach errors—reading error messages, debugging, and refining their logic. This method helps students see that **mistakes are a natural part of learning to code**, reducing frustration and increasing resilience.  

Additionally, incorporating **student predictions** before running code enhances engagement and retention. Instead of passively watching, students **actively think through the logic** and compare their expectations to actual results, reinforcing deeper understanding.

## **Takeaway**  
Module 7 highlights **active learning methods** that **shift students from passive consumers to active participants** in CS education. Peer Instruction and Live Coding foster **engagement, collaboration, and deeper conceptual understanding**.
